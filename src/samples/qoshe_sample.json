The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has recently published another sobering report, based on a synthesis of several years of scientific research. Besides highlighting the urgent need to act on climate change, this report identifies essential measures which should be adopted on an emergency basis to avoid climate catastrophe The first major step the IPCC urges states to focus on is methane reduction. Methane is a relatively short-lived air pollutant (which lasts around 20 years in the atmosphere before turning into carbon dioxide), but it has a disastrous impact on global warming.
