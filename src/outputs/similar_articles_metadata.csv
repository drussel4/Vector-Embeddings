US Preparing Mass AI Surveillance of its Citizens - Report
 
Over 500 AI projects - each receiving thousands if not millions of dollars in federal funding - are reportedly being amassed to clamp down on ""misinformation"" and ""disinformation"" online and identify the origins of what Washington deems hate speech, according to a report by The Federalist. 
Primer Technologies' $3m award for its ""social media event monitoring"" allows it to assess online conversations, identify who takes part in them, the relationships between participants, and their location, as well as the ""sentiment"" of the discussion and any opposing narratives, the report says. 
The Department of Defense also allegedly gave $1.5m to PeakMetrics, which tracks over 1.5m news sources, blogs, social networks, podcasts, TV/radio, [and] email newsletters,"" and was awarded a separate payment from the Air Force to ""create technology for rapid assessment and quantification of disinformation for DoD operators,"" the paper adds.",0.5,0.09655561,0.6037767

What is going on? ~~~ Linda Forsythe Left-Wing NewsGuard Awarded Pentagon Contract, Records Show The Pentagon (Getty Images) Friday, 10 March 2023 02 33 PM EST NewsGuard, a left-wing media monitoring organization which claims to rate the credibility of news websites, was awarded nearly 750,000 from the Department of Defense in 2021 according to publicly available records. The revelation comes in the latest ""Twitter Files"" post by Matt Taibbi. In a series of posts detailing internal communications among Twitter executives, Taibbi suggests a collaboration of government and the company of what appears to be a coordinated effort to censor or slant information available to the public and individuals ‚Äî particularly conservatives. Two U.S. agencies he identified included the State Department's Global Engagement Center and the Department of Defense. Taibbi was concerned about the government grants to an organization that targets news outlets, writing ""Some NGOs (non-governmental organizations), like the GEC-funded Global Disinformation Index or the DOD-funded Newsguard, not only seek content moderation but apply subjective 'risk' or 'reliability' scores to media outlets, which can result in reduction in revenue."" He continued ""Do we want government in this role?"" Government records show a purchase order from the Department of Defense amounting to 749,387 with the recipient listed as NewsGuard Technologies Inc. Also listed a start date of Sept. 7, 2021, and an end date of Dec. 8, 2022. The company's ratings have been used by advertising agencies such as Publics Group and Magnite, as well as the Pentagon and the American Federation of Teachers. NewsGuard is a for-profit company founded in 2018 by Steve Brill, a media entrepreneur who has also been a long-time and prolific Democratic Party supporter, including having made donations to former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Sen. Chuck Schumer. The Media Research Center has examined NewsGuard's ""ratings"" system and found the service continually favors left-wing and liberal news outlets as ""trusted"" and negatively rates conservative ones as not reliable. Newsguard negatively rates leading conservative outlets like Washington Times, Newsmax, Breitbart, Federalist, Epoch Times, Red State, Prager U, Daily Wire, and others. Last week, Florida's CFO, Jimmy Patronis, wrote to Newsguard saying the company's actions are in line with the ""environmental, social, and governance"" (ESG) standards used by liberal organizations to blacklist groups that dissent from their views. Patronis noted that that the Florida Legislature is targeting that in its upcoming session, and that NewsGuard's efforts appear to be a larger push to create ""social credit scores"" that will result in ""debanking"" and ""deplatforming"" private companies. Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., who chairs the Republican Study Committee, questioned NewsGuard's neutrality in a letter sent to the AFT last year saying, ""the organization regularly gave high marks to obviously progressive and left leaning outlets such as Occupy Democrats, The Nation, and Jacobin, which have published articles promoting progressive views on matters such as riots and property destruction and socialism."" According to Banks ""These are hardly unbiased entities, and any rating system that ranks them as such deserves our scrutiny. To make matters worse, NewsGuard has even ranked several Chinese state-run media outlets higher ‚Äî that is, more trustworthy/truthful ‚Äî than popular conservative U.S. news sources."" NewsGuard defended the contract, saying it was not ""government funded.""",0.5,0.52530855,0.4008595

Almost identical to how GEC described Disinfo Cloud in congressional testimony, the State Department's webpage marketed it as a ""one-stop shop"" to ""identify and then test tools that counter propaganda and disinformation."" ""Fact checking"" and ""media authentication"" are just a couple of the types of technologies available through the dashboard. GEC didn't just promote Disinfo Cloud or give Big Tech access to what GEC called ""the U.S. government's online repository."" Government employees at GEC also offered to help private companies identify tools to suit their specific needs. Just ""write"" to the GEC's Technology Engagement Division about ""what your office needs to counter propaganda and disinformation,"" the State Department instructed on its webpage, and the government will ""assist"" in finding ""a technological solution."" 'Testbed' Access to Disinfo Cloud, according to the State Department's webpage, also provides ""a gateway"" to the GEC's Technology Engagement Division's ""Testbed,"" allowing users to review and test the technology against their unique needs. While Stewart's emails don't expressly mention the ""Testbed"" feature, the State Department boasts that the ""private sector"" uses both Disinfo Cloud and Testbed. The GEC's webpage also invites Disinfo Cloud users to ask ""for assistance in identifying a technological solution or draft a test proposal for a tool."" If Disinfo Cloud users can't find a tool that works for them, the GEC Technology Engagement team stresses it ""is open to insights and is here to help implement ideas to move the counter propaganda and disinformation mission forward."" Infomercials Deposition testimony by FBI Agent Elvis Chan suggests GEC's marketing of the censorship tools went beyond making cold calls (or emails) to LinkedIn and other Big Tech companies. It also seemingly went further than providing product advice and samples on Disinfo Cloud The GEC's Technology Engagement Division apparently hosted infomercials to help the private vendors market their censorship software. Chan, the assistant special agent in charge of the cyber branch at the FBI's San Francisco field office, was ""one of the primary people"" communicating with social media companies about supposed ""disinformation,"" and thus is one of the named defendants in Missouri v. Biden. As part of that litigation, the plaintiffs deposed Chan. During questioning, Chan testified that ahead of the 2020 election, he periodically spoke with Stewart, who would meet with the social media companies separately from Chan. According to Chan, Stewart met with policy individuals with the various social media companies about ""different initiatives."" Those initiatives included various kinds of vendor-made software ""that they would pilot to see if they could detect malign foreign influence on social media platforms."" Chan further testified that Stewart and GEC ""would provide webinars"" from these vendors. As Chan explained, "" T he State Department was just providing a venue where different vendors could show off their products."" The presentations were open to the general public, said Chan, but the GEC ""would invite all sorts of audiences, to include researchers, employees from State Department counterparts, so typically Ministry of Foreign Affairs."" The intended audience, according to Chan, was ""State Department-equivalent personnel, social media companies, and researchers."" Chan said he attended only a couple of the webinars because the companies took only a ""surface-level"" look at the content, and thus he didn't consider the technology useful to the FBI. But apparently, it was fine for the State Department to market the same tools to social media companies. From Chan's deposition testimony, it appears Stewart, the GEC's then-senior adviser, made the equivalent of sales calls and hosted infomercials, all for the purpose of pushing various censorship services to social media companies. It is unclear whether these webinars were in addition to the GEC's ""Tech Demo Series"" ‚Äî at which private vendors showcased their knack for fighting so-called disinformation for ""U.S. government counterparts and foreign partners"" ‚Äî or whether, after the GEC sent a full-time representative to Silicon Valley in December of 2019 (presumably Stewart), the Tech Demo Series was opened to the public. However, given that the official Disinfo Cloud Twitter account promoted the Tech Demo Series, it seems likely that GEC expanded its target audience for the series to include the private sector and other Disinfo Cloud users. Either way, Chan's deposition testimony reveals our government marketed censorship technology to social media companies through ""webinars."" And while Chan claimed he didn't think GEC endorsed the products, the government expressly represented the Disinfo Cloud technology as tools to ""assist"" with attacking so-called disinformation. The Tools So what exactly were those tools? From open-source material, it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify the entire dataset of tech companies featured on Disinfo Cloud or participating in the Tech Demo Series. That's because Disinfo Cloud has ""been retired as a GEC-sponsored effort,"" according to the State Department. The DisinfoCloud.com webpage has also been shuttered. But because GEC ran various ""tech challenges,"" giving winners State Department ""sponsorship"" on the government's Disinfo Cloud Testbed ‚Äî advertised as worth 25,000 ‚Äî among other things, several censorship companies involved can be identified, including NewsGuard, PeakMetrics, and Omelas. NewsGuard's censorship technology includes ""its unreliable reliability ratings database of thousands of news and information websites and a second database of purported hoaxes,"" as I detailed in March. NewsGuard's winning tech-challenge entry built upon those databases and used ""AI and social listening tools to identify the initial source of the hoax,"" and to find instances of the hoax being ""repeated or amplified"" online. The second winner, PeakMetrics, offered a dashboard for tracking mentions of a topic across multiple media channels with social listening technology. The third winner, Omelas, developed tools to visually map online information. The government gave these winners the ability to pilot their technology on Disinfo Cloud's Testbed. Then it promoted Disinfo Cloud to social media giants as offering ""access to companies, technology, and tools that can assist with identifying, understanding, and addressing disinformation."" So were NewsGuard, PeakMetrics, and Omelas among the companies GEC marketed to Big Tech? Did they participate in the government-run Tech Demos and present infomercials to the private sector? Did GEC help these vendors test their products for private companies on the Testbed? In Practice Consider the implications, using NewsGuard to illustrate. NewsGuard rates various media outlets on a 100-point scale and provides a red ""unreliable"" rating if its ""experts"" score the news source below 60. The company rates The Federalist ""red"" and claims it is one of the top-10 ""most influential misinformers."" Conversely, some of the outlets that botched the biggest political stories of the century maintain a 100 percent reliability score. The government awarded NewsGuard a 25,000 prize to develop new technology on Disinfo Cloud, using, in part, that ratings system as a backbone. NewsGuard would later receive an additional 750,000 from the government to advance the development of its censorship technology. PeakMetrics and Omelas also both scored additional government funding of 1.5 and 1 million respectively. But think about the government's other behind-the-scenes censorship entanglements. The government, via your tax dollars, funded both Disinfo Cloud, which provided the technology necessary to pilot the program, and the outside contractor, Park Advisors, that managed it. The State Department's GEC promoted the companies and technology featured on Disinfo Cloud, and a government liaison working for GEC personally contacted social media companies to encourage them to use the platform. The government also hosted Tech Demo Series for the vendors to market their products to the private sector. Disinfo Cloud regularly promoted private censorship technology on its official Twitter account and retweeted NewsGuard's announcement of its partnership with Mediabrands to ""bring NewsGaurd's rating work to TV news programming. Then beyond promoting the censorship tools, government employees working with GEC helped social media and private-sector businesses identify, test, and tweak the most ""appropriate"" technology for their ""needs."" And what are those ""needs?"" Censoring the speech of you and your fellow Americans. A Scandal Like No Other This scandal far surpasses the one that formerly ensnared GEC, when it was revealed the State Department awarded the Global Disinformation Index (GDI) ‚Äî another ""ratings"" company that blacklists conservative outlets ‚Äî 100,000 as part of the U.S.-Paris Tech Challenge.",0.5,0.5051392,0.404978

Financial Blacklisting: NewsGuard Advises Advertisers to Avoid Pro-Trump Media

NewsGuard, the news-filtering browser extension recently partnered with Microsoft and run by neoconservatives, Obama-Clinton alumni, and other assorted Trump haters, has advised advertisers to withdraw their business from websites on its blacklist of ""unreliable"" news websites ‚Äî a list that includes Breitbart News, The Drudge Report, and the Daily Mail‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶The effect isn't merely to silence pro-Trump media. It also ensures advertisers don't market their products to Trump voters, causing them to rely less and less on consumers in the heartland, and more on progressive consumers who read establishment news sources.

In 2019 there was a report by La Corte News that revealed conservative sites are twice as likely to be rated unreliable as liberal publishers.

Today we found out the United States Department of Defense was using taxpayer dollars to censor conservatives and independent media online.

The DOD awarded $749,387 to Newsguard in September 2021.

Newsquard has NEVER criticized the mainstream media for lying about Trump-Russia collusion, the Hunter Biden laptop, COVID and vaccines.

From Matt Taibbi: ""Some NGOs, like the GEC-funded Global Disinformation Index or the DOD-funded Newsguard, not only seek content moderation but apply subjective ""risk"" or ""reliability"" scores to media outlets, which can result in reduction in revenue. Do we want government in this role?""

Two other companies, PeakMetrics, which offers a dashboard for tracking mentions of a topic across multiple media channels, and Omelas, which offers a product for visually mapping online information, were also named winners of the contest."" Notably, the tech company Omelas focuses on the ""actions of overt state and nonstate actors"" who exert ""malicious influence on the web."" Omelas regularly contributes with speeches and written submissions to influential global organizations and domestic institutions like UChicago's Data and Democracy initiative and the UChicago Center for Effective Government, attended by the likes of Tiana Epps-Johnson with CTCL. Teachers' Union Signs Contract with NewsGuard in 2022 The American Federation of Teachers, with its 1.7 million members, announced its ""pathbreaking"" partnership with NewsGuard in January 2022 with the rollout of the ""free, real-time traffic light news ratings,"" a ""crucial news literacy tool"" for students nationwide. The announcement coincided with National News Literacy Week. They released this video on the dangers of misinformation at the time of the announcement Touted as a ""game-changer for teachers and families drowning in an ocean of online dishonesty,"" a ""licensed copy of NewsGuard's browser extension"" would help students ""separate fact from fiction, as we help them develop their critical-thinking and analytical skills."" AFT President Randi Weingarten gave NewsGuard glowing reviews ""NewsGuard is a great tool in this regard. It is a beacon of clarity to expose the dark depths of the internet and uplift those outlets committed to truth and honesty rather than falsehoods and fabrications. This historic deal will not only help us steer clear of increasingly fetid waters‚Äîit will provide a valuable lesson in media literacy and a discussion point for teachers in class on what can and can't be trusted."" NewsGuard's 2022 Social Impact Report NewsGuard issued its first ""social impact report"" in 2022. The report championed NewsGuard's provision of tools that would promote ""online safety for readers, brands, and democracies."" Its CEOs proudly state a mission to fight false claims of ""Nazis running Ukraine's government and Americans running bioweapons labs in Ukraine,"" COVID-19 misinformation, and misinformation surrounding the mid-term elections. According to the report, ""more than 938,200 people were exposed to COVID-19 vaccine myths between Oct. 2021-Feb. 2022 on social media."" The report also reveals NewsGuard's exposure of ""pink slime sites pushing Democratic propaganda in battleground states ahead of the midterm elections."" NewsGuard 2022 What are NewsGuard's Stated Standards and Procedures? The NewsGuard Dashboard ""helps clients access NewsGuard's database of News Reliability Ratings and Misinformation Fingerprints through a powerful, searchable web interface purpose-built for use by businesses seeking to identify and mitigate risks from misinformation and disinformation. Users can browse NewsGuard's ratings, get alerts about changes in the news and information environment, and stay on top of emerging false narratives and trends."" The site issues ""stoplight red/green journalistic ratings"" for news sources. Influence watch describes NewsGuard as a ""web browser extension that rates the trustworthiness of online news sites based on nine criteria, providing a trust score between 0 and 100."" Nine basic ""apolitical criteria"" for journalistic practice are outlined on the NewsGuard website. The criteria are listed in order of importance and weighted accordingly. Satire sites, platforms, and news aggregators ""are given separate designations and are not scored using the nine criteria."" The nine criteria and standards for credibility are as follows Does not repeatedly publish false content (22 Points) Gathers and presents information responsibly (18 Points) Regularly corrects or clarifies errors (12.5 Points) Handles the difference between news and opinion responsibly (12.5 Points) Avoids deceptive headlines (10 Points) Website discloses ownership and financing (7.5 Points) Clearly labels advertising (7.5 Points) Reveals who's in charge, including possible conflicts of interest (5 Points) The site provides the names of content creators, along with either contact or biographical information (5 Points) NewsGuard Ratings/0-100 According to the website, NewsGuard substantiates the basis for its ratings with ""evidence and examples to back up its assessments, includ ing any relevant comments from the publisher, and indicat ing the history of the sites' ratings."" NewsGuard employs ""a team of journalists and experienced editors"" who make an effort to contact publishers who might ""fail"" specific criteria before a rating or an updated rating is published, ""ensuring a publisher 's ability to reply."" NewsGuard has recently dropped its stoplight rating system and now uses its ""nutrition label"" exclusively. Are Conservatives Being Targeted by NewsGuard? According to a series of email exchanges (read below) made public by the Conservative organization PragerU, Newsguard targets conservative organizations unfairly. NewsMax, Dave Rubin, and Harmeet Dhillon also allege having been targeted by NewsGuard. Rubin says the service sums up ""so much of what is wrong right now in American culture relative to big tech and government."" NewsGuard claimed PragerU was spreading ""misleading content"" on its website. Sites with scores below 60 are labeled ""unreliable."" PragerU and NewsGuard Exchange Emails The emails from 2021 between PragerU's Chief of Staff Adrienne Johnson and the NewsGuard Co-CEOs seem to indicate PragerU was reputationally and financially damaged by a NewsGuard red rating of 57. Notably, officials from PragerU clarified in its emails that it is not a news website, but a ""nonprofit focused on producing and marketing well-researched, issue-driven educational content"" featuring healthy debate from experts. As such, PragerU discloses its donations with the required IRS 990 form and does not disclose that information on its website as ""required by NewsGuard."" NewsGuard disregarded the disclosure because of its standards, not because the information was unavailable. NewsGuard penalized PragerU for never having ""corrected one-sided claims related to COVID or hydroxy,"" all of which were objectively and verifiably true. Specifically, NewsGuard challenged PragerU's sharing of videos featuring America's Frontline Doctors ""that promoted false claims about the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine"" as a ""proven cure for COVID-19."" Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin have been well-known as effective early treatments for COVID-19 since early in the pandemic but were suppressed by the government and its overly helpful legacy media partners. NewsGuard challenged PragerU's removal of the videos because PragerU failed to publish a correction once the videos were removed. Sadly, PragerU had removed the videos not because they were incorrect but ""due to overall social media censorship on the topic."" One of the emails shows CEO Marissa Streit writing that PragerU ""created an ROI analysis on our end, and we removed it rather than face the penalties of censorship."" NewsGuards also reprimanded PragerU influencer Will Witt who stated in a video that ""children aren't actually dying from the virus."" Witt allegedly cited without attribution a ""study with the statistics of children ages 0-18 who had died from COVID-19, ""none of whom died."" Witt's statement was not far from the mark because CDC data shows that almost no healthy children have died from COVID-19. It appears that NewsGuard may have held Witt accountable for inexact wording, not for the spirit of the claim. It is not clear from the emails whether ",0.5,0.5029383,0.44568065

'Cold-Calling' Big Tech The Stewart emails establish that in 2020, federal government actors contacted social media giants to promote GEC's Disinfo Cloud. GEC represented that this government platform provided ""companies, technology, and tools"" to ""assist with identifying, understanding, and addressing disinformation."" Then it gave private tech companies access to Disinfo Cloud Almost identical to how GEC described Disinfo Cloud in congressional testimony, the State Department's webpage marketed it as a ""one-stop shop"" to ""identify and then test tools that counter propaganda and disinformation."" ""Fact checking"" and ""media authentication"" are just a couple of the types of technologies available through the dashboard. GEC didn't just promote Disinfo Cloud or give Big Tech access to what GEC called ""the U.S. government's online repository."" Government employees at GEC also offered to help private companies identify tools to suit their specific needs. Just ""write"" to the GEC's Technology Engagement Division about ""what your office needs to counter propaganda and disinformation,"" the State Department instructed on its webpage, and the government will ""assist"" in finding ""a technological solution."" 'Testbed' Access to Disinfo Cloud, according to the State Department's webpage, also provides ""a gateway"" to the GEC's Technology Engagement Division's ""Testbed,"" allowing users to review and test the technology against their unique needs. While Stewart's emails don't expressly mention the ""Testbed"" feature, the State Department boasts that the ""private sector"" uses both Disinfo Cloud and Testbed. The GEC's webpage also invites Disinfo Cloud users to ask ""for assistance in identifying a technological solution or draft a test proposal for a tool."" If Disinfo Cloud users can't find a tool that works for them, the GEC Technology Engagement team stresses it ""is open to insights and is here to help implement ideas to move the counter propaganda and disinformation mission forward."" Infomercials Deposition testimony by FBI Agent Elvis Chan suggests GEC's marketing of the censorship tools went beyond making cold calls (or emails) to LinkedIn and other Big Tech companies. It also seemingly went further than providing product advice and samples on Disinfo Cloud The GEC's Technology Engagement Division apparently hosted infomercials to help the private vendors market their censorship software. Chan, the assistant special agent in charge of the cyber branch at the FBI's San Francisco field office, was ""one of the primary people"" communicating with social media companies about supposed ""disinformation,"" and thus is one of the named defendants in Missouri v. Biden. As part of that litigation, the plaintiffs deposed Chan. During questioning, Chan testified that ahead of the 2020 election, he periodically spoke with Stewart, who would meet with the social media companies separately from Chan. According to Chan, Stewart met with policy individuals with the various social media companies about ""different initiatives."" Those initiatives included various kinds of vendor-made software ""that they would pilot to see if they could detect malign foreign influence on social media platforms."" Chan further testified that Stewart and GEC ""would provide webinars"" from these vendors. As Chan explained, "" T he State Department was just providing a venue where different vendors could show off their products."" The presentations were open to the general public, said Chan, but the GEC ""would invite all sorts of audiences, to include researchers, employees from State Department counterparts, so typically Ministry of Foreign Affairs."" The intended audience, according to Chan, was ""State Department-equivalent personnel, social media companies, and researchers."" Chan said he attended only a couple of the webinars because the companies took only a ""surface-level"" look at the content, and thus he didn't consider the technology useful to the FBI. But apparently, it was fine for the State Department to market the same tools to social media companies. From Chan's deposition testimony, it appears Stewart, the GEC's then-senior adviser, made the equivalent of sales calls and hosted infomercials, all for the purpose of pushing various censorship services to social media companies. It is unclear whether these webinars were in addition to the GEC's ""Tech Demo Series"" ‚Äî at which private vendors showcased their knack for fighting so-called disinformation for ""U.S. government counterparts and foreign partners"" ‚Äî or whether, after the GEC sent a full-time representative to Silicon Valley in December of 2019 (presumably Stewart), the Tech Demo Series was opened to the public. However, given that the official Disinfo Cloud Twitter account promoted the Tech Demo Series, it seems likely that GEC expanded its target audience for the series to include the private sector and other Disinfo Cloud users. Either way, Chan's deposition testimony reveals our government marketed censorship technology to social media companies through ""webinars."" And while Chan claimed he didn't think GEC endorsed the products, the government expressly represented the Disinfo Cloud technology as tools to ""assist"" with attacking so-called disinformation. The Tools So what exactly were those tools? From open-source material, it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify the entire dataset of tech companies featured on Disinfo Cloud or participating in the Tech Demo Series. That's because Disinfo Cloud has ""been retired as a GEC-sponsored effort,"" according to the State Department. The DisinfoCloud.com webpage has also been shuttered. But because GEC ran various ""tech challenges,"" giving winners State Department ""sponsorship"" on the government's Disinfo Cloud Testbed ‚Äî advertised as worth 25,000 ‚Äî among other things, several censorship companies involved can be identified, including NewsGuard, PeakMetrics, and Omelas. NewsGuard's censorship technology includes ""its unreliable reliability ratings database of thousands of news and information websites and a second database of purported hoaxes,"" as I detailed in March. NewsGuard's winning tech-challenge entry built upon those databases and used ""AI and social listening tools to identify the initial source of the hoax,"" and to find instances of the hoax being ""repeated or amplified"" online. The second winner, PeakMetrics, offered a dashboard for tracking mentions of a topic across multiple media channels with social listening technology. The third winner, Omelas, developed tools to visually map online information. The government gave these winners the ability to pilot their technology on Disinfo Cloud's Testbed. Then it promoted Disinfo Cloud to social media giants as offering ""access to companies, technology, and tools that can assist with identifying, understanding, and addressing disinformation."" So were NewsGuard, PeakMetrics, and Omelas among the companies GEC marketed to Big Tech? Did they participate in the government-run Tech Demos and present infomercials to the private sector? Did GEC help these vendors test their products for private companies on the Testbed? In Practice Consider the implications, using NewsGuard to illustrate. NewsGuard rates various media outlets on a 100-point scale and provides a red ""unreliable"" rating if its ""experts"" score the news source below 60. The company rates The Federalist ""red"" and claims it is one of the top-10 ""most influential misinformers."" Conversely, some of the outlets that botched the biggest political stories of the century maintain a 100 percent reliability score. The government awarded NewsGuard a 25,000 prize to develop new technology on Disinfo Cloud, using, in part, that ratings system as a backbone. NewsGuard would later receive an additional 750,000 from the government to advance the development of its censorship technology. PeakMetrics and Omelas also both scored additional government funding of 1.5 and 1 million respectively. But think about the government's other behind-the-scenes censorship entanglements. The government, via your tax dollars, funded both Disinfo Cloud, which provided the technology necessary to pilot the program, and the outside contractor, Park Advisors, that managed it. The State Department's GEC promoted the companies and technology featured on Disinfo Cloud, and a government liaison working for GEC personally contacted social media companies to encourage them to use the platform. The government also hosted Tech Demo Series for the vendors to market their products to the private sector. Disinfo Cloud regularly promoted private censorship technology on its official Twitter account and retweeted NewsGuard's announcement of its partnership with Mediabrands to ""bring NewsGaurd's rating work to TV news programming. Then beyond promoting the censorship tools, government employees working with GEC helped social media and private-sector businesses identify, test, and tweak the most ""appropriate"" technology for their ""needs.""",0.5,0.5051392,0.40637258

To appreciate fully the danger this poses to free speech requires Americans to consider the use of that technology with these seven additional details. 1. Everything Everywhere All At Once First, the AI and ML technology under development will mine every conceivable mode of conversation for the government. Consider, for example, the databases monitored by just a few of the companies the government is paying to develop this AI and ML technology. PeakMetrics, the recipient of a 1.5 million award, tracks millions of news sites, blogs, global social platforms, podcasts, TV and radio, and email newsletters. Omelas Inc., which received more than 1 million in taxpayer money, culls data from ""the most influential newspapers, TV channels, government offices, militant groups, and more across a dozen social networks and messaging apps, thousands of websites, and thousands of RSS feeds."" Alethea Group, which received a Phase I award of nearly 50,000 to develop a ""machine learning tool for proactive disinformation/misinformation detection, assessment, and mitigation,"" boasts it covers data sources including mainstream and ""fringe"" social media platforms, peer-to-peer messaging platforms, blogs and forums, state-affiliated media sites, ""gray"" propaganda sites, and the dark web. Newsguard, awarded 750,000 by the DOD, offers two databases, including its unreliable reliability ratings database of thousands of news and information websites and a second database of purported hoaxes. Primer, which scored a 3 million award to develop its technology, offers a database that looks to news and media data sources, publicly captured images, the dark web, cyberattacks shared by the general public, and classified‚Äîpresumably for government clients‚Äîand unclassified data sources. Primer also partners with Flashpoint, which adds ""Telegram, Reddit, Discord, and ""the deep and dark web"" to the databases mined. 2. We're Talking Americans, Not Just Russian Bots It is also important to recognize that the AI and ML technology under development will not just mine foreign or state-connected actors, but will monitor everyone's speech. Both the government grants and the web pages of the monitoring companies confirm this reality. We also know from the ""Twitter Files"" that the government and its fellow residents in the Censorship-Industrial Complex view the speech of Americans as related to foreign influence operations merely because the viewpoint matches what they claim is an adversary's perspective. And we know the government pushed for the censorship of ordinary Americans. Declare Your Independence! Profit outside the rigged system! Protect yourself from tyranny and economic collapse. Learn to live free and spread peace! By its nature, AI and ML technology has unlimited potential to flag problematic speech on any imaginable subject. Here, the past is prologue Speech need not involve terrorism, acts of war, or even our electoral process for our government to consider it within its purview to fact-check. (It also need not be false; see point 4). The ""Twitter Files"" and recent events provide Americans a glimpse into the breadth of the topics the government may deem harmful narratives worthy of censor‚Äîfrom elections, to vaccines, to runs on grocery stores. Underlying the government's obsession with silencing misinformation, disinformation, and mal-information is the ""Great Power Competition"" perspective of foreign relations, under which China and Russia represent a constant threat to America's power, influences, and interests. With the government viewing foreign relations through the Great Power Competition paradigm, speech on any topic, touching even tangentially on America's ""power, influences, and interests,"" will be fair game for censorship efforts. 3. The Great Power Competition Renders Everything Fair Game for Censorship While to convincingly prove this reality requires a deeper expos√©‚Äîcoming soon‚Äîon the Great Power Competition's connection to the government's focus on misinformation, disinformation, and mal-information, last week Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Arizona, showcased the current thinking inspiring our leaders. During a conference call with the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation about the Silicon Valley Bank bailout, Kelly asked whether there was ""a way to censor information on social media to prevent a run on the banks."" Kelly's question was ""couched"" ""in a concern that foreign actors would be doing this,"" Rep. Thomas Massie told Public, but, according to Massie, Kelly ""didn't suggest the censorship should be limited to foreigners or to things that were untrue."" The move from the censorship of terrorism to the silencing of supposed interference in elections to censoring posts about ""bank runs"" follows naturally from the shift in foreign relations paradigms from the War on Terror to the Great Powers Competition. The latter views anything affecting American power or influence as fair game. We also saw this shift with the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) proposal to consider ""financial misinformation"" within its purview. The government's censorship efforts won't stop at supposed ""financial misinformation,"" however, because anything and everything journalists report and citizens discuss affects America's ""power, influence, and interest."" So, the government's development of technology to monitor the entirety of the internet foretells a much more dangerous threat than apparent on the surface. 4. The Government Brands True Speech Misinformation The threat to free speech stemming from the government's monitoring of the internet is further increased by our overlords' willingness to brand true speech ""misinformation, disinformation, or mal-information"" and then seek to censor it. The ""Twitter Files"" also exposed this reality, with our government and its lackeys seeking the censorship of true facts that might lead to ""vaccine hesitancy"" or reveal runs on grocery stores. That our government would seek to silence true speech on such matters gives Americans reason to fear further censorship of true information. 5. Faulty Analysis and Biased Censors The ""Twitter Files"" also revealed that censorship demands by the government, think tanks, and academic institutions relied on faulty misinformation analyses, including ones that identified innocent Americans as foreign actors. Also, many of those involved in the disinformation industry maintain left-leaning bias and a penchant for targeting conservatives.",0.5,0.3900882,0.5658134

PeakMetrics' entry into the Censorship-Industrial Complex is even more revealing of the government's grooming of for-profit businesses than NewsGuard's. Before competing in the Pentagon-State Department misinformation and disinformation contest, in early 2020, PeakMetrics participated in the ""Air Force Accelerator."" Prior to that, PeakMetrics appeared focused on developing software for ""communications professionals and marketers"" to allow businesses (and politicians) to ""monitor"" the media landscape. In announcing its selection for the Air Force Accelerator program, PeakMetrics stressed it will continue its original mission while working with the government to develop its ""unique monitoring and measuring tool to detect misinformation campaigns."" This program was branded an ""Air Force Accelerator Powered by Techstars."" The managing director of the ""accelerator program"" declared, ""In this new age of cyberwarfare and social manipulation, media monitoring, detection, and mitigation of misinformation operations is becoming more important than bombs and bullets,"" stressing ""PeakMetrics provides a unique monitoring and measuring tool to detect misinformation campaigns before they cause harm."" U.S. Military Funding Companies to Monitor Americans Details on this program give insights into the Censorship-Industrial Complex growth industry. The ""accelerator"" represents a partnership between the Air Force and the private venture-capital Techstars program. Techstars provides start-up funding, legal and accounting support, networking, and mentorship to its companies, which include PeakMetrics. The accelerator program targets ""small businesses"" in early-stage development ""that offer products that can benefit troops as well as a broad swath of the commercial market."" From this backdrop we see our government enticing private businesses seeking start-up cash to adapt their technology and mission to monitor supposed misinformation and disinformation for the Defense Department. Not only do the for-profit tech firms benefit financially by joining the Censorship-Industrial Complex, so does the venture capital firm Techstars that moved them in. The government is not only funding the development of technology for defense use, which it will purchase from the for-profit businesses. Also, and significantly, because the DOD targets products that can benefit ""a broad swath of the commercial market,"" our tax dollars are funding the development of a media-monitoring product that can then be deployed to censor ordinary Americans via Big Tech. Case Study PeakMetrics PeakMetrics provides a perfect case study in this potential scenario. Shortly after its selection to participate in the Air Force accelerator, it received a nearly 50,000 award from the SBIRC for a Phase I project to ""leverage"" its ""proprietary data pipeline"" and ""machine learning algorithms"" that ""ingest millions of data points per day from news articles, social media Posts and TV + Radio broadcasts."" So the government paid PeakMetrics tax dollars to further develop its technology products that can be used to locate phrases and words online. The objective of the Phase I project was ""to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential"" of PeakMetrics' proposed R amp;D efforts. The research and development program, according to the award, related to the DOD's efforts to ""counteract information warfare through deep fake detection, sentiment analysis and measurement of message effectiveness."" Federal funding for PeakMetrics then increased, multiple times. In August 2020 PeakMetrics competed in the jointly sponsored Pentagon-State Department COVID-19 misinformation and disinformation contest. It won a 25,000 award, along with NewsGuard, to pilot its technology with the government. Two additional Small Business Innovation Research Center awards followed in March 2021, to finance two Phase II studies by PeakMetrics. First, one 750,000 award entitled, ""Rapid Analysis of Disinformation Campaigns for Operators,"" funded PeakMetrics' creation of ""technology for rapid assessment and quantification of disinformation for DoD operators, with emphasis on crosschannel media analysis leveraging actual language processing."" The second 2021 award, also for 750,000, financed PeakMetrics Phase II research related to China, and its development of a ""Foreign-Language Event Detection"" program. 3 Troubling Tidbits Set aside, momentarily, the question of whether providing a government proven abusive of free speech the tools to monitor and censor the populace represents a social good. Even so, a review of open-source material reveals three independently troubling tidbits. First, PeakMetrics has boasted it ""worked with mission-critical clients including the U.S. State Department and the Department of Defense through the 2020 and 2022 U.S. elections and is now expanding its offerings to commercial partners."" What precisely did PeakMetrics do during the 2020 and 2022 elections to assist the U.S. State Department and Department of Defense? Did it use its proprietary software to assist the government's efforts to bury the Hunter Biden laptop story? If not, what? PeakMetrics did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A related concern flows from PeakMetrics using its relationship and funding from the government to offer commercial products that push for censoring private speech. Here, again, because PeakMetrics did not respond to inquiries from The Federalist, it is unclear whether the R amp;D funded by taxpayer dollars served the dual purpose of expanding PeakMetrics' censorship products for corporate America. Especially disconcerting here is the partnership between PeakMetrics and NewsGuard, announced in January 2022, which relies on NewsGuard's untrustworthy ""trust ratings"" for media outlets. Under the agreement between the two for-profit businesses‚Äîboth of which received seed funding from the government to develop products‚Äîcorporate clients can use PeakMetrics' media monitoring programs to ""filter, sort, and discover mentions of a brand or topic based on NewsGuard's credibility ratings."" It also says clients can then assess whether their brand appears on supposed ""credible news sources"" or on ""misinformation websites."" This partnership agreement also gave PeakMetrics' ""business-tier customers"" access to NewsGuard's ""trust ratings and detailed Nutrition Labels."" January 2022 is not the first time PeakMetrics and NewsGuard partnered. One year earlier, the two for-profit businesses peddled a dubious analysis of Parler posts that exemplifies many of the problems with the entire disinformation cottage industry. ""Special Report 87% of news shared on Parler before Jan. 6th came from misinformation sites,"" NewsGuard's headline screamed. The ""Special Report"" explained that for the jointly undertaken analysis, PeakMetrics collected data and extracted links from Parler for the week before Jan. 6, 2021, with NewsGuard analyzing the data against its database of ""credibility ratings"" for thousands of news sources. That analysis, the two companies reported, showed ""that news links shared on the social media app Parler in the period surrounding the Jan. 6th Capitol insurrection came overwhelmingly from misinformation websites . . . "" Of the more than 17,000 public Parler posts, the PeakMetrics-NewsGuard analysis revealed ""87 percent of the news links shared during that time period came from websites with red 'unreliable' ratings from NewsGuard‚Ä¶"" It is difficult to conceive of a more classic example of ""disinformation,"" or the use of information to intentionally mislead. PeakMetrics and NewsGuard used a faulty analysis‚Äîone that assumed any story published by ""red""-rated media outlets the week before the Jan. 6. riots, reported false claims about the November 2020 election‚Äîto imply both the ""red-rated"" news outlets and Parler helped cause an ""insurrection."" Accusing Their Opponents of Their Own Actions For all NewsGuard's grand talk about transparency and journalistic ethics, this faulty analysis gives away its game",0.5,1.0,1.0

GEC didn't just promote Disinfo Cloud or give Big Tech access to what GEC called ""the U.S. government's online repository."" Government employees at GEC also offered to help private companies identify tools to suit their specific needs. Just ""write"" to the GEC's Technology Engagement Division about ""what your office needs to counter propaganda and disinformation,"" the State Department instructed on its webpage, and the government will ""assist"" in finding ""a technological solution."" 'Testbed' Access to Disinfo Cloud, according to the State Department's webpage, also provides ""a gateway"" to the GEC's Technology Engagement Division's ""Testbed,"" allowing users to review and test the technology against their unique needs. While Stewart's emails don't expressly mention the ""Testbed"" feature, the State Department boasts that the ""private sector"" uses both Disinfo Cloud and Testbed. The GEC's webpage also invites Disinfo Cloud users to ask ""for assistance in identifying a technological solution or draft a test proposal for a tool."" If Disinfo Cloud users can't find a tool that works for them, the GEC Technology Engagement team stresses it ""is open to insights and is here to help implement ideas to move the counter propaganda and disinformation mission forward."" Infomercials Deposition testimony by FBI Agent Elvis Chan suggests GEC's marketing of the censorship tools went beyond making cold calls (or emails) to LinkedIn and other Big Tech companies. It also seemingly went further than providing product advice and samples on Disinfo Cloud The GEC's Technology Engagement Division apparently hosted infomercials to help the private vendors market their censorship software. Chan, the assistant special agent in charge of the cyber branch at the FBI's San Francisco field office, was ""one of the primary people"" communicating with social media companies about supposed ""disinformation,"" and thus is one of the named defendants in Missouri v. Biden. As part of that litigation, the plaintiffs deposed Chan. During questioning, Chan testified that ahead of the 2020 election, he periodically spoke with Stewart, who would meet with the social media companies separately from Chan. According to Chan, Stewart met with policy individuals with the various social media companies about ""different initiatives."" Those initiatives included various kinds of vendor-made software ""that they would pilot to see if they could detect malign foreign influence on social media platforms."" Chan further testified that Stewart and GEC ""would provide webinars"" from these vendors. As Chan explained, "" T he State Department was just providing a venue where different vendors could show off their products."" The presentations were open to the general public, said Chan, but the GEC ""would invite all sorts of audiences, to include researchers, employees from State Department counterparts, so typically Ministry of Foreign Affairs."" The intended audience, according to Chan, was ""State Department-equivalent personnel, social media companies, and researchers."" Chan said he attended only a couple of the webinars because the companies took only a ""surface-level"" look at the content, and thus he didn't consider the technology useful to the FBI. But apparently, it was fine for the State Department to market the same tools to social media companies. From Chan's deposition testimony, it appears Stewart, the GEC's then-senior adviser, made the equivalent of sales calls and hosted infomercials, all for the purpose of pushing various censorship services to social media companies. It is unclear whether these webinars were in addition to the GEC's ""Tech Demo Series"" ‚Äî at which private vendors showcased their knack for fighting so-called disinformation for ""U.S. government counterparts and foreign partners"" ‚Äî or whether, after the GEC sent a full-time representative to Silicon Valley in December of 2019 (presumably Stewart), the Tech Demo Series was opened to the public. However, given that the official Disinfo Cloud Twitter account promoted the Tech Demo Series, it seems likely that GEC expanded its target audience for the series to include the private sector and other Disinfo Cloud users. Either way, Chan's deposition testimony reveals our government marketed censorship technology to social media companies through ""webinars."" And while Chan claimed he didn't think GEC endorsed the products, the government expressly represented the Disinfo Cloud technology as tools to ""assist"" with attacking so-called disinformation. The Tools So what exactly were those tools? From open-source material, it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify the entire dataset of tech companies featured on Disinfo Cloud or participating in the Tech Demo Series. That's because Disinfo Cloud has ""been retired as a GEC-sponsored effort,"" according to the State Department. The DisinfoCloud.com webpage has also been shuttered. But because GEC ran various ""tech challenges,"" giving winners State Department ""sponsorship"" on the government's Disinfo Cloud Testbed ‚Äî advertised as worth 25,000 ‚Äî among other things, several censorship companies involved can be identified, including NewsGuard, PeakMetrics, and Omelas. NewsGuard's censorship technology includes ""its unreliable reliability ratings database of thousands of news and information websites and a second database of purported hoaxes,"" as I detailed in March. NewsGuard's winning tech-challenge entry built upon those databases and used ""AI and social listening tools to identify the initial source of the hoax,"" and to find instances of the hoax being ""repeated or amplified"" online. The second winner, PeakMetrics, offered a dashboard for tracking mentions of a topic across multiple media channels with social listening technology. The third winner, Omelas, developed tools to visually map online information. The government gave these winners the ability to pilot their technology on Disinfo Cloud's Testbed. Then it promoted Disinfo Cloud to social media giants as offering ""access to companies, technology, and tools that can assist with identifying, understanding, and addressing disinformation."" So were NewsGuard, PeakMetrics, and Omelas among the companies GEC marketed to Big Tech? Did they participate in the government-run Tech Demos and present infomercials to the private sector? Did GEC help these vendors test their products for private companies on the Testbed? In Practice Consider the implications, using NewsGuard to illustrate. NewsGuard rates various media outlets on a 100-point scale and provides a red ""unreliable"" rating if its ""experts"" score the news source below 60. The company rates The Federalist ""red"" and claims it is one of the top-10 ""most influential misinformers."" Conversely, some of the outlets that botched the biggest political stories of the century maintain a 100 percent reliability score. The government awarded NewsGuard a 25,000 prize to develop new technology on Disinfo Cloud, using, in part, that ratings system as a backbone. NewsGuard would later receive an additional 750,000 from the government to advance the development of its censorship technology. PeakMetrics and Omelas also both scored additional government funding of 1.5 and 1 million respectively. But think about the government's other behind-the-scenes censorship entanglements. The government, via your tax dollars, funded both Disinfo Cloud, which provided the technology necessary to pilot the program, and the outside contractor, Park Advisors, that managed it. The State Department's GEC promoted the companies and technology featured on Disinfo Cloud, and a government liaison working for GEC personally contacted social media companies to encourage them to use the platform. The government also hosted Tech Demo Series for the vendors to market their products to the private sector. Disinfo Cloud regularly promoted private censorship technology on its official Twitter account and retweeted NewsGuard's announcement of its partnership with Mediabrands to ""bring NewsGaurd's rating work to TV news programming. Then beyond promoting the censorship tools, government employees working with GEC helped social media and private-sector businesses identify, test, and tweak the most ""appropriate"" technology for their ""needs."" And what are those ""needs?"" Censoring the speech of you and your fellow Americans. A Scandal Like No Other This scandal far surpasses the one that formerly ensnared GEC, when it was revealed the State Department awarded the Global Disinformation Index (GDI) ‚Äî another ""ratings"" company that blacklists conservative outlets ‚Äî 100,000 as part of the U.S.-Paris Tech Challenge.

During the hearing, reporter Michael Shellenberger explained that NewsGuard uses its ratings system to drive advertiser revenue away from conservative sites or other ""disfavored publications."" In an email to Taibbi, Newsguard's CEO Gordon Crovitz denied receiving government funding, stating instead that the government pays for access to its data. The Pentagon, he wrote, is specifically looking for evidence of ""Russian and Chinese disinformation."" However, NewsGuard received a 25,000 award from the Pentagon in 2020, after winning the military's 'Countering Covid-19 Disinformation' challenge, The Federalist reported on Friday. A year later, Newsguard was given 750,000 to develop an AI-powered database of ""misinformation networks"" alongside the Department of Defense. NewsGuard is one of several such businesses funded by the Pentagon. PeakMetrics was another winner of the Covid-19 challenge, earning a 25,000 grant to develop ""social listening"" technology for the military. It received a further 1.5 million from the federal government in 2021, but even before that the company had been singled out as potentially useful to the Pentagon. In early 2020, PeakMetrics took part in the 'Air Force Accelerator' program, under which it developed ""measuring tools to detect misinformation campaigns."" According to The Federalist, it put these tools to use during the 2020 and 2022 elections in the elections. At that point, PeakMetrics solely worked for the State Department and Pentagon, before later offering its services to the private sector. It is unclear what the Pentagon aimed to achieve during these election monitoring campaigns. PeakMetrics did not respond to a request for comment by The Federalist. Aside from paying private companies to develop web surveillance tools, the Pentagon, along with a number of other government agencies and departments, has directly engaged in social media censorship in recent years. Internal communications from Twitter published by Taibbi, Shellenberger, and other journalists, showed that the social media giant ""directly assisted"" the American military's online influence campaigns and censored ""anti-Ukraine narratives"" on behalf of multiple intelligence agencies. The platform also received extensive lists of accounts to ban from the State Department and associated NGOs. Welcome to the police state of America. Post navigation",0.5,0.5113437,0.44613373

""Fact checking"" and ""media authentication"" are just a couple of the types of technologies available through the dashboard. GEC didn't just promote Disinfo Cloud or give Big Tech access to what GEC called ""the U.S. government's online repository."" Government employees at GEC also offered to help private companies identify tools to suit their specific needs. Just ""write"" to the GEC's Technology Engagement Division about ""what your office needs to counter propaganda and disinformation,"" the State Department instructed on its webpage, and the government will ""assist"" in finding ""a technological solution."" 'Testbed' Access to Disinfo Cloud, according to the State Department's webpage, also provides ""a gateway"" to the GEC's Technology Engagement Division's ""Testbed,"" allowing users to review and test the technology against their unique needs. While Stewart's emails don't expressly mention the ""Testbed"" feature, the State Department boasts that the ""private sector"" uses both Disinfo Cloud and Testbed. The GEC's webpage also invites Disinfo Cloud users to ask ""for assistance in identifying a technological solution or draft a test proposal for a tool."" If Disinfo Cloud users can't find a tool that works for them, the GEC Technology Engagement team stresses it ""is open to insights and is here to help implement ideas to move the counter propaganda and disinformation mission forward."" Infomercials Deposition testimony by FBI Agent Elvis Chan suggests GEC's marketing of the censorship tools went beyond making cold calls (or emails) to LinkedIn and other Big Tech companies. It also seemingly went further than providing product advice and samples on Disinfo Cloud The GEC's Technology Engagement Division apparently hosted infomercials to help the private vendors market their censorship software. Chan, the assistant special agent in charge of the cyber branch at the FBI's San Francisco field office, was ""one of the primary people"" communicating with social media companies about supposed ""disinformation,"" and thus is one of the named defendants in Missouri v. Biden. As part of that litigation, the plaintiffs deposed Chan. During questioning, Chan testified that ahead of the 2020 election, he periodically spoke with Stewart, who would meet with the social media companies separately from Chan. According to Chan, Stewart met with policy individuals with the various social media companies about ""different initiatives."" Those initiatives included various kinds of vendor-made software ""that they would pilot to see if they could detect malign foreign influence on social media platforms."" Chan further testified that Stewart and GEC ""would provide webinars"" from these vendors. As Chan explained, "" T he State Department was just providing a venue where different vendors could show off their products."" The presentations were open to the general public, said Chan, but the GEC ""would invite all sorts of audiences, to include researchers, employees from State Department counterparts, so typically Ministry of Foreign Affairs."" The intended audience, according to Chan, was ""State Department-equivalent personnel, social media companies, and researchers."" Chan said he attended only a couple of the webinars because the companies took only a ""surface-level"" look at the content, and thus he didn't consider the technology useful to the FBI. But apparently, it was fine for the State Department to market the same tools to social media companies. From Chan's deposition testimony, it appears Stewart, the GEC's then-senior adviser, made the equivalent of sales calls and hosted infomercials, all for the purpose of pushing various censorship services to social media companies. It is unclear whether these webinars were in addition to the GEC's ""Tech Demo Series"" ‚Äî at which private vendors showcased their knack for fighting so-called disinformation for ""U.S. government counterparts and foreign partners"" ‚Äî or whether, after the GEC sent a full-time representative to Silicon Valley in December of 2019 (presumably Stewart), the Tech Demo Series was opened to the public. However, given that the official Disinfo Cloud Twitter account promoted the Tech Demo Series, it seems likely that GEC expanded its target audience for the series to include the private sector and other Disinfo Cloud users. Either way, Chan's deposition testimony reveals our government marketed censorship technology to social media companies through ""webinars."" And while Chan claimed he didn't think GEC endorsed the products, the government expressly represented the Disinfo Cloud technology as tools to ""assist"" with attacking so-called disinformation. The Tools So what exactly were those tools? From open-source material, it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify the entire dataset of tech companies featured on Disinfo Cloud or participating in the Tech Demo Series. That's because Disinfo Cloud has ""been retired as a GEC-sponsored effort,"" according to the State Department. The DisinfoCloud.com webpage has also been shuttered. But because GEC ran various ""tech challenges,"" giving winners State Department ""sponsorship"" on the government's Disinfo Cloud Testbed ‚Äî advertised as worth 25,000 ‚Äî among other things, several censorship companies involved can be identified, including NewsGuard, PeakMetrics, and Omelas. NewsGuard's censorship technology includes ""its unreliable reliability ratings database of thousands of news and information websites and a second database of purported hoaxes,"" as I detailed in March. NewsGuard's winning tech-challenge entry built upon those databases and used ""AI and social listening tools to identify the initial source of the hoax,"" and to find instances of the hoax being ""repeated or amplified"" online. The second winner, PeakMetrics, offered a dashboard for tracking mentions of a topic across multiple media channels with social listening technology. The third winner, Omelas, developed tools to visually map online information. The government gave these winners the ability to pilot their technology on Disinfo Cloud's Testbed. Then it promoted Disinfo Cloud to social media giants as offering ""access to companies, technology, and tools that can assist with identifying, understanding, and addressing disinformation."" So were NewsGuard, PeakMetrics, and Omelas among the companies GEC marketed to Big Tech? Did they participate in the government-run Tech Demos and present infomercials to the private sector? Did GEC help these vendors test their products for private companies on the Testbed? In Practice Consider the implications, using NewsGuard to illustrate. NewsGuard rates various media outlets on a 100-point scale and provides a red ""unreliable"" rating if its ""experts"" score the news source below 60. The company rates The Federalist ""red"" and claims it is one of the top-10 ""most influential misinformers."" Conversely, some of the outlets that botched the biggest political stories of the century maintain a 100 percent reliability score. The government awarded NewsGuard a 25,000 prize to develop new technology on Disinfo Cloud, using, in part, that ratings system as a backbone. NewsGuard would later receive an additional 750,000 from the government to advance the development of its censorship technology. PeakMetrics and Omelas also both scored additional government funding of 1.5 and 1 million respectively. But think about the government's other behind-the-scenes censorship entanglements. The government, via your tax dollars, funded both Disinfo Cloud, which provided the technology necessary to pilot the program, and the outside contractor, Park Advisors, that managed it. The State Department's GEC promoted the companies and technology featured on Disinfo Cloud, and a government liaison working for GEC personally contacted social media companies to encourage them to use the platform. The government also hosted Tech Demo Series for the vendors to market their products to the private sector. Disinfo Cloud regularly promoted private censorship technology on its official Twitter account and retweeted NewsGuard's announcement of its partnership with Mediabrands to ""bring NewsGaurd's rating work to TV news programming. Then beyond promoting the censorship tools, government employees working with GEC helped social media and private-sector businesses identify, test, and tweak the most ""appropriate"" technology for their ""needs."" And what are those ""needs?"" Censoring the speech of you and your fellow Americans. A Scandal Like No Other This scandal far surpasses the one that formerly ensnared GEC, when it was revealed the State Department awarded the Global Disinformation Index (GDI) ‚Äî another ""ratings"" company that blacklists conservative outlets ‚Äî 100,000 as part of the U.S.-Paris Tech Challenge.

Omelas Inc., which received more than 1 million in taxpayer money, culls data from ""the most influential newspapers, TV channels, government offices, militant groups, and more across a dozen social networks and messaging apps, thousands of websites, and thousands of RSS feeds."" Alethea Group, which received a Phase I award of nearly 50,000 to develop a ""machine learning tool for proactive disinformation/misinformation detection, assessment, and mitigation,"" boasts it covers data sources including mainstream and ""fringe"" social media platforms, peer-to-peer messaging platforms, blogs and forums, state-affiliated media sites, ""gray"" propaganda sites, and the dark web. Newsguard, awarded 750,000 by the DOD, offers two databases, including its unreliable reliability ratings database of thousands of news and information websites and a second database of purported hoaxes. Primer, which scored a 3 million award to develop its technology, offers a database that looks to news and media data sources, publicly captured images, the dark web, cyberattacks shared by the general public, and classified‚Äîpresumably for government clients‚Äîand unclassified data sources. Primer also partners with Flashpoint, which adds ""Telegram, Reddit, Discord, and ""the deep and dark web"" to the databases mined. 2. We're Talking Americans, Not Just Russian Bots It is also important to recognize that the AI and ML technology under development will not just mine foreign or state-connected actors, but will monitor everyone's speech. Both the government grants and the web pages of the monitoring companies confirm this reality. We also know from the ""Twitter Files"" that the government and its fellow residents in the Censorship-Industrial Complex view the speech of Americans as related to foreign influence operations merely because the viewpoint matches what they claim is an adversary's perspective. And we know the government pushed for the censorship of ordinary Americans. By its nature, AI and ML technology has unlimited potential to flag problematic speech on any imaginable subject. Here, the past is prologue Speech need not involve terrorism, acts of war, or even our electoral process for our government to consider it within its purview to fact-check. (It also need not be false; see point 4). The ""Twitter Files"" and recent events provide Americans a glimpse into the breadth of the topics the government may deem harmful narratives worthy of censor‚Äîfrom elections, to vaccines, to runs on grocery stores. Underlying the government's obsession with silencing misinformation, disinformation, and mal-information is the ""Great Power Competition"" perspective of foreign relations, under which China and Russia represent a constant threat to America's power, influences, and interests. With the government viewing foreign relations through the Great Power Competition paradigm, speech on any topic, touching even tangentially on America's ""power, influences, and interests,"" will be fair game for censorship efforts. 3. The Great Power Competition Renders Everything Fair Game for Censorship While to convincingly prove this reality requires a deeper expos√©‚Äîcoming soon‚Äîon the Great Power Competition's connection to the government's focus on misinformation, disinformation, and mal-information, last week Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Arizona, showcased the current thinking inspiring our leaders. During a conference call with the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation about the Silicon Valley Bank bailout, Kelly asked whether there was ""a way to censor information on social media to prevent a run on the banks."" Kelly's question was ""couched"" ""in a concern that foreign actors would be doing this,"" Rep. Thomas Massie told Public, but, according to Massie, Kelly ""didn't suggest the censorship should be limited to foreigners or to things that were untrue."" The move from the censorship of terrorism to the silencing of supposed interference in elections to censoring posts about ""bank runs"" follows naturally from the shift in foreign relations paradigms from the War on Terror to the Great Powers Competition. The latter views anything affecting American power or influence as fair game. We also saw this shift with the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) proposal to consider ""financial misinformation"" within its purview. The government's censorship efforts won't stop at supposed ""financial misinformation,"" however, because anything and everything journalists report and citizens discuss affects America's ""power, influence, and interest."" So, the government's development of technology to monitor the entirety of the internet foretells a much more dangerous threat than apparent on the surface. 4. The Government Brands True Speech Misinformation The threat to free speech stemming from the government's monitoring of the internet is further increased by our overlords' willingness to brand true speech ""misinformation, disinformation, or mal-information"" and then seek to censor it. The ""Twitter Files"" also exposed this reality, with our government and its lackeys seeking the censorship of true facts that might lead to ""vaccine hesitancy"" or reveal runs on grocery stores. That our government would seek to silence true speech on such matters gives Americans reason to fear further censorship of true information. 5. Faulty Analysis and Biased Censors The ""Twitter Files"" also revealed that censorship demands by the government, think tanks, and academic institutions relied on faulty misinformation analyses, including ones that identified innocent Americans as foreign actors. Also, many of those involved in the disinformation industry maintain left-leaning bias and a penchant for targeting conservatives. In furthering its plans to monitor the internet for supposedly harmful narratives to silence, the government is continuing to work with biased groups, including ones that pushed faulty analyses, adding to the threat to free speech. 6. The Government's Partners Are Poised to Censor The government's push to develop AI and ML technology to mine the internet is even more terrifying knowing that a Censorship Complex has already been built. The ""Twitter Files"" revealed the breadth and depth of the complex, with every alphabet-soup federal agency working with the social media giants and an array of think tanks and academic institutions, and with the legacy media providing an assist when censorship requests went ignored. While Elon Musk may have exited Twitter from the group, the Censorship Complex still stands tall and ready to silence the speech of those who dare dissent. This public-private collaboration makes the government's move to monitor the internet even more threatening to free speech.",0.5,0.40123886,0.5661077

Everything Everywhere All At Once First, the AI and ML technology under development will mine every conceivable mode of conversation for the government. Consider, for example, the databases monitored by just a few of the companies the government is paying to develop this AI and ML technology. PeakMetrics, the recipient of a 1.5 million award, tracks millions of news sites, blogs, global social platforms, podcasts, TV and radio, and email newsletters. Omelas Inc., which received more than 1 million in taxpayer money, culls data from ""the most influential newspapers, TV channels, government offices, militant groups, and more across a dozen social networks and messaging apps, thousands of websites, and thousands of RSS feeds.""

""Unlike other entities mentioned in the hearing, we are not a non-profit funded by government grants. We are a business with many licensees paying to access our proprietary data, including government entities that pay to license our data.""The specific tool being licensed by the Pentagon, known as Misinformation Fingerprints, is described in a 2020 white paper as a tool that combines artificial intelligence and human analysis to search the internet and flag ""misinformation narratives"" spreading online.Mr. Crovitz said, for example, the tool could be used by defense analysts to track the origin and spread of misinformation related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and determine whether those narratives are linked to Russian state-backed information operations.""It's valuable for people in the defense community, whose job it is to understand hostile information operations, particularly from Russia and China, which are both very active,"" he said in an interview with The Washington Times He said that tool is different than the company's flagship business of rating news outlets.""It is true we're proud of our work with the Department of Defense,"" he said. ""It frankly surprised us that members of Congress raised questions about that contract and we think they did that out of a misunderstanding of the nature of our work. We're sure the members of Congress don't begrudge the Pentagon for having tools to counter Russian and Chinese disinformation. That's why we were surprised by the characterization of the work.""The Media Research Center, a conservative-leaning watchdog, found ""clear liberal bias in NewsGuard's misinformation scoring system."" According to MRC's analysis, NewsGuard has scored left-leaning news outlets 27 points higher, on average, than right-leaning outlets.Mr. Crovitz has called the MRC study ""unscientific."" He said the group ""cherry-picked"" data to skew the results ‚Äî the same barb critics have aimed at his outfit House Republicans previously raised questions about NewsGuard after it signed a deal with the American Federation of Teachers to put the rating tools on the devices of millions of American teachers and school children In letters to both organizations, Reps.

Omelas Inc., which received more than 1 million in taxpayer money, culls data from ""the most influential newspapers, TV channels, government offices, militant groups, and more across a dozen social networks and messaging apps, thousands of websites, and thousands of RSS feeds."" Alethea Group, which received a Phase I award of nearly 50,000 to develop a ""machine learning tool for proactive disinformation/misinformation detection, assessment, and mitigation,"" boasts it covers data sources including mainstream and ""fringe"" social media platforms, peer-to-peer messaging platforms, blogs and forums, state-affiliated media sites, ""gray"" propaganda sites, and the dark web. Newsguard, awarded 750,000 by the DOD, offers two databases, including its unreliable reliability ratings database of thousands of news and information websites and a second database of purported hoaxes. Primer, which scored a 3 million award to develop its technology, offers a database that looks to news and media data sources, publicly captured images, the dark web, cyberattacks shared by the general public, and classified‚Äîpresumably for government clients‚Äîand unclassified data sources. Primer also partners with Flashpoint, which adds ""Telegram, Reddit, Discord, and ""the deep and dark web"" to the databases mined. 2. We're Talking Americans, Not Just Russian Bots It is also important to recognize that the AI and ML technology under development will not just mine foreign or state-connected actors, but will monitor everyone's speech. Both the government grants and the web pages of the monitoring companies confirm this reality. We also know from the ""Twitter Files"" that the government and its fellow residents in the Censorship-Industrial Complex view the speech of Americans as related to foreign influence operations merely because the viewpoint matches what they claim is an adversary's perspective. And we know the government pushed for the censorship of ordinary Americans. By its nature, AI and ML technology has unlimited potential to flag problematic speech on any imaginable subject. Here, the past is prologue Speech need not involve terrorism, acts of war, or even our electoral process for our government to consider it within its purview to fact-check. (It also need not be false; see point 4). The ""Twitter Files"" and recent events provide Americans a glimpse into the breadth of the topics the government may deem harmful narratives worthy of censor‚Äîfrom elections, to vaccines, to runs on grocery stores. Underlying the government's obsession with silencing misinformation, disinformation, and mal-information is the ""Great Power Competition"" perspective of foreign relations, under which China and Russia represent a constant threat to America's power, influences, and interests. With the government viewing foreign relations through the Great Power Competition paradigm, speech on any topic, touching even tangentially on America's ""power, influences, and interests,"" will be fair game for censorship efforts. 3. The Great Power Competition Renders Everything Fair Game for Censorship While to convincingly prove this reality requires a deeper expos√©‚Äîcoming soon‚Äîon the Great Power Competition's connection to the government's focus on misinformation, disinformation, and mal-information, last week Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Arizona, showcased the current thinking inspiring our leaders. During a conference call with the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation about the Silicon Valley Bank bailout, Kelly asked whether there was ""a way to censor information on social media to prevent a run on the banks."" Kelly's question was ""couched"" ""in a concern that foreign actors would be doing this,"" Rep. Thomas Massie told Public, but, according to Massie, Kelly ""didn't suggest the censorship should be limited to foreigners or to things that were untrue."" The move from the censorship of terrorism to the silencing of supposed interference in elections to censoring posts about ""bank runs"" follows naturally from the shift in foreign relations paradigms from the War on Terror to the Great Powers Competition. The latter views anything affecting American power or influence as fair game. We also saw this shift with the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) proposal to consider ""financial misinformation"" within its purview. The government's censorship efforts won't stop at supposed ""financial misinformation,"" however, because anything and everything journalists report and citizens discuss affects America's ""power, influence, and interest."" So, the government's development of technology to monitor the entirety of the internet foretells a much more dangerous threat than apparent on the surface. 4. The Government Brands True Speech Misinformation The threat to free speech stemming from the government's monitoring of the internet is further increased by our overlords' willingness to brand true speech ""misinformation, disinformation, or mal-information"" and then seek to censor it. The ""Twitter Files"" also exposed this reality, with our government and its lackeys seeking the censorship of true facts that might lead to ""vaccine hesitancy"" or reveal runs on grocery stores. That our government would seek to silence true speech on such matters gives Americans reason to fear further censorship of true information. 5. Faulty Analysis and Biased Censors The ""Twitter Files"" also revealed that censorship demands by the government, think tanks, and academic institutions relied on faulty misinformation analyses, including ones that identified innocent Americans as foreign actors. Also, many of those involved in the disinformation industry maintain left-leaning bias and a penchant for targeting conservatives. In furthering its plans to monitor the internet for supposedly harmful narratives to silence, the government is continuing to work with biased groups, including ones that pushed faulty analyses, adding to the threat to free speech. 6. The Government's Partners Are Poised to Censor The government's push to develop AI and ML technology to mine the internet is even more terrifying knowing that a Censorship Complex has already been built. The ""Twitter Files"" revealed the breadth and depth of the complex, with every alphabet-soup federal agency working with the social media giants and an array of think tanks and academic institutions, and with the legacy media providing an assist when censorship requests went ignored. While Elon Musk may have exited Twitter from the group, the Censorship Complex still stands tall and ready to silence the speech of those who dare dissent.",0.5,0.4237596,0.5661077

NewsGuard is a private company that rates news outlets by their ""reliability"" and reputation for sharing ""falsehoods and misinformation narratives."" Before a Congressional hearing last week, journalist Matt Taibbi labeled the company a part of the ""censorship-industrial complex,"" publishing an image of a 750,000 grant award from the Pentagon to the firm. During the hearing, reporter Michael Shellenberger explained that NewsGuard uses its ratings system to drive advertiser revenue away from conservative sites or other ""disfavored publications."" In an email to Taibbi, Newsguard's CEO Gordon Crovitz denied receiving government funding, stating instead that the government pays for access to its data. The Pentagon, he wrote, is specifically looking for evidence of ""Russian and Chinese disinformation.""

A year later, Newsguard was given 750,000 to develop an AI-powered database of ""misinformation networks"" alongside the Department of Defense. NewsGuard is one of several such businesses funded by the Pentagon. PeakMetrics was another winner of the Covid-19 challenge, earning a 25,000 grant to develop ""social listening"" technology for the military. It received a further 1.5 million from the federal government in 2021, but even before that the company had been singled out as potentially useful to the Pentagon. In early 2020, PeakMetrics took part in the 'Air Force Accelerator' program, under which it developed ""measuring tools to detect misinformation campaigns."" According to The Federalist, it put these tools to use during the 2020 and 2022 elections in the US. At that point, PeakMetrics solely worked for the US State Department and Pentagon, before later offering its services to the private sector. It is unclear what the Pentagon aimed to achieve during these election monitoring campaigns. PeakMetrics did not respond to a request for comment by The Federalist. READ MORE Biden's former 'disinfo czar' pleads for donations Aside from paying private companies to develop web surveillance tools, the Pentagon, along with a number of other government agencies and departments, has directly engaged in social media censorship in recent years. Internal communications from Twitter published by Taibbi, Shellenberger, and other journalists, showed that the social media giant ""directly assisted"" the US military's online influence campaigns and censored ""anti-Ukraine narratives"" on behalf of multiple intelligence agencies.

The report states that through more than 500 federally funded contracts or grants since 2020, the government is seeking to take a firm grasp on ""misinformation"" and ""disinformation,"" using AI and ML to tune in to internet chatter. The Federalist reports that the systems will have the ability to identify the origins of what the government deems to be threatening messages or hate speech in real time. Therefore, it would be possible to prevent amplification of the speech before any unapproved messaging goes viral across internet platforms. Some of the companies receiving federal funding include websites like NewsGuard, which received 750,000 from the Small Business Innovation Research Center to develop its ""Fingerprints"" program, which the company describes as ""tracking disinformation campaigns with human intelligence and AI."" Another company, PeakMetrics, has received 1.5 million from the Department of Defense. PeakMetrics tracks over 1.5 million ""news sources, blogs, social networks, podcasts, TV/radio, and email newsletters"" and received money from the Air Force to ""create technology for rapid assessment and quantification of disinformation for DoD operators."" Omelas Inc. received over 1 million in federal funding for ""research and development."" The company describes its work as analyzing the most ""influential newspapers, TV channels, government offices, militant groups, and more across a dozen social networks and messaging apps, thousands of websites, and thousands of RSS feeds,"" including in Russia, Iran, and China. A company called Primer Technologies was awarded 3 million for what is described as ""social media event monitoring."" The company's document titled ""The Strategic Imperative of AI to Speed Up Decision Cycles"" outlines how its AI technology can assess online conversations. It can help identify ""entities, relationships amp; locations"" of those in the discussion, identify the ""sentiment"" in multiple languages, curate relevant images related to the topic, and identify opposing narratives and who is saying them. ""Primer alerts users to hard-to-find connections such as evolving sentiment across multi-lingual streaming data, and bot-amplified narratives, an indicator for potential disinformation. Command allows the user to track and categorize threats surfacing and clustering images and narratives for reporting and further analysis,"" the document reads. Tracking of online conversations and large, sweeping databases of news-related information, in conjunction with AI recognition of speech, appear to be main focus of the selected government programs, which are often procured by military entities such as the U.S. Air Force or Navy.

'Cold-Calling' Big Tech The Stewart emails establish that in 2020, federal government actors contacted social media giants to promote GEC's Disinfo Cloud. GEC represented that this government platform provided ""companies, technology, and tools"" to ""assist with identifying, understanding, and addressing disinformation."" Then it gave private tech companies access to Disinfo Cloud. Almost identical to how GEC described Disinfo Cloud in congressional testimony, the State Department's webpage marketed it as a ""one-stop shop"" to ""identify and then test tools that counter propaganda and disinformation."" ""Fact checking"" and ""media authentication"" are just a couple of the types of technologies available through the dashboard. GEC didn't just promote Disinfo Cloud or give Big Tech access to what GEC called ""the U.S. government's online repository."" Government employees at GEC also offered to help private companies identify tools to suit their specific needs. Just ""write"" to the GEC's Technology Engagement Division about ""what your office needs to counter propaganda and disinformation,"" the State Department instructed on its webpage, and the government will ""assist"" in finding ""a technological solution."" 'Testbed' Access to Disinfo Cloud, according to the State Department's webpage, also provides ""a gateway"" to the GEC's Technology Engagement Division's ""Testbed,"" allowing users to review and test the technology against their unique needs. While Stewart's emails don't expressly mention the ""Testbed"" feature, the State Department boasts that the ""private sector"" uses both Disinfo Cloud and Testbed. The GEC's webpage also invites Disinfo Cloud users to ask ""for assistance in identifying a technological solution or draft a test proposal for a tool."" If Disinfo Cloud users can't find a tool that works for them, the GEC Technology Engagement team stresses it ""is open to insights and is here to help implement ideas to move the counter propaganda and disinformation mission forward."" Infomercials Deposition testimony by FBI Agent Elvis Chan suggests GEC's marketing of the censorship tools went beyond making cold calls (or emails) to LinkedIn and other Big Tech companies. It also seemingly went further than providing product advice and samples on Disinfo Cloud The GEC's Technology Engagement Division apparently hosted infomercials to help the private vendors market their censorship software. Chan, the assistant special agent in charge of the cyber branch at the FBI's San Francisco field office, was ""one of the primary people"" communicating with social media companies about supposed ""disinformation,"" and thus is one of the named defendants in Missouri v. Biden. As part of that litigation, the plaintiffs deposed Chan. During questioning, Chan testified that ahead of the 2020 election, he periodically spoke with Stewart, who would meet with the social media companies separately from Chan. According to Chan, Stewart met with policy individuals with the various social media companies about ""different initiatives."" Those initiatives included various kinds of vendor-made software ""that they would pilot to see if they could detect malign foreign influence on social media platforms."" Chan further testified that Stewart and GEC ""would provide webinars"" from these vendors. As Chan explained, "" T he State Department was just providing a venue where different vendors could show off their products."" The presentations were open to the general public, said Chan, but the GEC ""would invite all sorts of audiences, to include researchers, employees from State Department counterparts, so typically Ministry of Foreign Affairs."" The intended audience, according to Chan, was ""State Department-equivalent personnel, social media companies, and researchers."" Chan said he attended only a couple of the webinars because the companies took only a ""surface-level"" look at the content, and thus he didn't consider the technology useful to the FBI. But apparently, it was fine for the State Department to market the same tools to social media companies. From Chan's deposition testimony, it appears Stewart, the GEC's then-senior adviser, made the equivalent of sales calls and hosted infomercials, all for the purpose of pushing various censorship services to social media companies. It is unclear whether these webinars were in addition to the GEC's ""Tech Demo Series"" ‚Äî at which private vendors showcased their knack for fighting so-called disinformation for ""U.S. government counterparts and foreign partners"" ‚Äî or whether, after the GEC sent a full-time representative to Silicon Valley in December of 2019 (presumably Stewart), the Tech Demo Series was opened to the public. However, given that the official Disinfo Cloud Twitter account promoted the Tech Demo Series, it seems likely that GEC expanded its target audience for the series to include the private sector and other Disinfo Cloud users. Either way, Chan's deposition testimony reveals our government marketed censorship technology to social media companies through ""webinars."" And while Chan claimed he didn't think GEC endorsed the products, the government expressly represented the Disinfo Cloud technology as tools to ""assist"" with attacking so-called disinformation. The Tools So what exactly were those tools? From open-source material, it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify the entire dataset of tech companies featured on Disinfo Cloud or participating in the Tech Demo Series. That's because Disinfo Cloud has ""been retired as a GEC-sponsored effort,"" according to the State Department. The DisinfoCloud.com webpage has also been shuttered. But because GEC ran various ""tech challenges,"" giving winners State Department ""sponsorship"" on the government's Disinfo Cloud Testbed ‚Äî advertised as worth 25,000 ‚Äî among other things, several censorship companies involved can be identified, including NewsGuard, PeakMetrics, and Omelas. NewsGuard's censorship technology includes ""its unreliable reliability ratings database of thousands of news and information websites and a second database of purported hoaxes,"" as I detailed in March. NewsGuard's winning tech-challenge entry built upon those databases and used ""AI and social listening tools to identify the initial source of the hoax,"" and to find instances of the hoax being ""repeated or amplified"" online. The second winner, PeakMetrics, offered a dashboard for tracking mentions of a topic across multiple media channels with social listening technology. The third winner, Omelas, developed tools to visually map online information. The government gave these winners the ability to pilot their technology on Disinfo Cloud's Testbed. Then it promoted Disinfo Cloud to social media giants as offering ""access to companies, technology, and tools that can assist with identifying, understanding, and addressing disinformation."" So were NewsGuard, PeakMetrics, and Omelas among the companies GEC marketed to Big Tech? Did they participate in the government-run Tech Demos and present infomercials to the private sector? Did GEC help these vendors test their products for private companies on the Testbed? In Practice Consider the implications, using NewsGuard to illustrate. NewsGuard rates various media outlets on a 100-point scale and provides a red ""unreliable"" rating if its ""experts"" score the news source below 60. The company rates The Federalist ""red"" and claims it is one of the top-10 ""most influential misinformers."" Conversely, some of the outlets that botched the biggest political stories of the century maintain a 100 percent reliability score. The government awarded NewsGuard a 25,000 prize to develop new technology on Disinfo Cloud, using, in part, that ratings system as a backbone. NewsGuard would later receive an additional 750,000 from the government to advance the development of its censorship technology. PeakMetrics and Omelas also both scored additional government funding of 1.5 and 1 million respectively. But think about the government's other behind-the-scenes censorship entanglements. The government, via your tax dollars, funded both Disinfo Cloud, which provided the technology necessary to pilot the program, and the outside contractor, Park Advisors, that managed it. The State Department's GEC promoted the companies and technology featured on Disinfo Cloud, and a government liaison working for GEC personally contacted social media companies to encourage them to use the platform. The government also hosted Tech Demo Series for the vendors to market their products to the private sector. Disinfo Cloud regularly promoted private censorship technology on its official Twitter account and retweeted NewsGuard's announcement of its partnership with Mediabrands to ""bring NewsGaurd's rating work to TV news programming. Then beyond promoting the censorship tools, government employees working with GEC helped social media and private-sector businesses identify, test, and tweak the most ""appropriate"" technology for their ""needs.""

Leftist Ratings Firm Doesn't Deny $749K DoD 'Grant,' Claims Not Gov't Funded","Leftist ratings firm NewsGuard claimed that it's not federally funded after journalists accused the organization of receiving government money at the recent Twitter Files hearing. But NewsGuard lists the Department of Defense and State Department as Partners and received a substantial Department of Defense ""grant"" in 2021. NewsGuard's co-CEO Gordon Crovitz claimed in the wake of the recent Twitter Files Congressional hearing that the leftist ratings firm is ""not a non-profit funded by government grants,"" according to an email screenshot tweeted March 10 by Washington Examiner Investigative Reporter Gabe Kaminsky."" But a payout of nearly 750,000 from the Department of Defense (DoD), which NewsGuard itself previously called a ""grant,"" seems to indicate otherwise. NewsGuard also lists DoD and the State Department as ""partners"" on its website. MRC Free Speech America reached out to NewsGuard General Manager Matt Skibinski about the DoD funding it had received. Skibinski did not deny the government contract, and then doubled down on the co-CEO's claim that NewsGuard is ""not"" government funded. ""That's like saying the Wuhan laboratory wasn't government funded,"" said MRC President Brent Bozell. ""They were just providing a service for the government."" MRC Free Speech America amp; MRC Business Vice President Dan Schneider said, ""All money is fungible. Whether it's a contract or a grant, NewsGuard still received funds from the federal government and has exhibited an obvious leftist bias."" A 2021 NewsGuard ""Social Impact Report"" undercuts the narrative currently being spun by the leftist ratings firm. NewsGuard referred to funding it had received in September 2021 as a ""grant through the Small Business Innovation and Research SBIR program."" SBIR is overseen by the DoD. The contract listed on USASpending.gov from the DoD to NewsGuard Technologies, Inc. shows the leftist ratings firm was awarded 749,387. Kaminsky tweeted on March 10 that NewsGuard co-CEO Gordon Crovitz sent Twitter Files journalist Matt Taibbi an email after Taibbi testified to Congress. The email in the screenshot Kaminsky provided claimed that comments made during the hearing that NewsGuard is ""U.S. government funded"" was a ""fundamental misunderstanding about NewsGuard and our work."" Crovitz insisted NewsGuard is ""not a non-profit funded by government grants,"" but a business whose data government entities ""pay to license."" In the email screenshot, Crovitz insisted government licensing has no impact on NewsGuard's ratings, but admitted NewsGuard ""alert s officials in the U.S. and in other democracies"" to supposed ""false narratives targeting America and its allies."" Crovitz insisted, ""We are proud of our work countering Russian and Chinese disinformation on behalf of Western democracies."" Crovitz's concluded ""So we are not 'funded' by the U.S. government, like you we oppose government censorship."" Taibbi's fellow Twitter Files journalist Michael Shellenberger tweeted in response to Kaminsky that he received a ""nearly identical"" email from Crovitz. The Media Research Center has been onto NewsGuard for quite some time. An MRC Free Speech America study published Dec. 13, 2021 showed that NewsGuard's ratings were skewed in favor of left-wing outlets. The average NewsGuard score for the outlets AllSides labeled ""left"" and ""lean left"" was 93/100, while the average rating for ""right"" and ""lean right"" outlets was a low 66/100‚Äîa 27 point disparity. MRC Free Speech America conducted the same study again a year later and confirmed NewsGuard's bias. The most recent study published Jan. 6, 2023 showed that NewsGuard rated left-leaning media outlets 25 points higher on average than right-leaning media outlets.

The report states that through more than 500 federally funded contracts or grants since 2020, the government is seeking to take a firm grasp on ""misinformation"" and ""disinformation,"" using AI and ML to tune in to internet chatter. The Federalist reports that the systems will have the ability to identify the origins of what the government deems to be threatening messages or hate speech in real time. Therefore, it would be possible to prevent amplification of the speech before any unapproved messaging goes viral across internet platforms. Some of the companies receiving federal funding include websites like NewsGuard, which received 750,000 from the Small Business Innovation Research Center to develop its ""Fingerprints"" program, which the company describes as ""tracking disinformation campaigns with human intelligence and AI."" Another company, PeakMetrics, has received 1.5 million from the Department of Defense. PeakMetrics tracks over 1.5 million ""news sources, blogs, social networks, podcasts, TV/radio, and email newsletters"" and received money from the Air Force to ""create technology for rapid assessment and quantification of disinformation for DoD operators."" Omelas Inc. received over 1 million in federal funding for ""research and development."" The company describes its work as analyzing the most ""influential newspapers, TV channels, government offices, militant groups, and more across a dozen social networks and messaging apps, thousands of websites, and thousands of RSS feeds,"" including in Russia, Iran, and China. A company called Primer Technologies was awarded 3 million for what is described as ""social media event monitoring."" The company's document titled ""The Strategic Imperative of AI to Speed Up Decision Cycles"" outlines how its AI technology can assess online conversations. It can help identify ""entities, relationships amp; locations"" of those in the discussion, identify the ""sentiment"" in multiple languages, curate relevant images related to the topic, and identify opposing narratives and who is saying them. ""Primer alerts users to hard-to-find connections such as evolving sentiment across multi-lingual streaming data, and bot-amplified narratives, an indicator for potential disinformation. Command allows the user to track and categorize threats surfacing and clustering images and narratives for reporting and further analysis,"" the document reads. Tracking of online conversations and large, sweeping databases of news-related information, in conjunction with AI recognition of speech, appear to be main focus of the selected government programs, which are often procured by military entities such as the U.S. Air Force or Navy.

Privacy Action Plan ‚Äì Live Your Life Online Again With Zero Fear (Sign Up Risk-Free Today) The areas of the internet the companies monitor differ somewhat, and each business offers its own unique AI and ML proprietary technology, but the underlying approach and goals remain identical The technology under development will ""mine"" large portions of the internet and identify conversations deemed indicative of an emerging harmful narrative, to allow the government to track those ""threats"" and adopt countermeasures before the messages go viral. With AI and ML identifying in real-time the origins of supposed influence operations and how the messages spread, the government will have the ability to preempt the amplification of the speech, squelching even true reporting before the general populace has an opportunity to learn the news. To appreciate fully the danger this poses to free speech requires Americans to consider the use of that technology with these seven additional details. 1. Everything Everywhere All At Once First, the AI and ML technology under development will mine every conceivable mode of conversation for the government. Consider, for example, the databases monitored by just a few of the companies the government is paying to develop this AI and ML technology. PeakMetrics, the recipient of a 1.5 million award, tracks millions of news sites, blogs, global social platforms, podcasts, TV and radio, and email newsletters. Omelas Inc., which received more than 1 million in taxpayer money, culls data from ""the most influential newspapers, TV channels, government offices, militant groups, and more across a dozen social networks and messaging apps, thousands of websites, and thousands of RSS feeds."" Alethea Group, which received a Phase I award of nearly 50,000 to develop a ""machine learning tool for proactive disinformation/misinformation detection, assessment, and mitigation,"" boasts it covers data sources including mainstream and ""fringe"" social media platforms, peer-to-peer messaging platforms, blogs and forums, state-affiliated media sites, ""gray"" propaganda sites, and the dark web. Newsguard, awarded 750,000 by the DOD, offers two databases, including its unreliable reliability ratings database of thousands of news and information websites and a second database of purported hoaxes. Technocracy Rising The Trojan Horse Of Global Transformation by Patrick Wood Primer, which scored a 3 million award to develop its technology, offers a database that looks to news and media data sources, publicly captured images, the dark web, cyberattacks shared by the general public, and classified‚Äîpresumably for government clients‚Äîand unclassified data sources. Primer also partners with Flashpoint, which adds ""Telegram, Reddit, Discord, and ""the deep and dark web"" to the databases mined. 2. We're Talking Americans, Not Just Russian Bots It is also important to recognize that the AI and ML technology under development will not just mine foreign or state-connected actors, but will monitor everyone's speech. Both the government grants and the web pages of the monitoring companies confirm this reality. We also know from the ""Twitter Files"" that the government and its fellow residents in the Censorship-Industrial Complex view the speech of Americans as related to foreign influence operations merely because the viewpoint matches what they claim is an adversary's perspective. And we know the government pushed for the censorship of ordinary Americans. By its nature, AI and ML technology has unlimited potential to flag problematic speech on any imaginable subject. Here, the past is prologue Speech need not involve terrorism, acts of war, or even our electoral process for our government to consider it within its purview to fact-check. (It also need not be false; see point 4). The ""Twitter Files"" and recent events provide Americans a glimpse into the breadth of the topics the government may deem harmful narratives worthy of censor‚Äîfrom elections, to vaccines, to runs on grocery stores. Underlying the government's obsession with silencing misinformation, disinformation, and mal-information is the ""Great Power Competition"" perspective of foreign relations, under which China and Russia represent a constant threat to America's power, influences, and interests. With the government viewing foreign relations through the Great Power Competition paradigm, speech on any topic, touching even tangentially on America's ""power, influences, and interests,"" will be fair game for censorship efforts. 3. The Great Power Competition Renders Everything Fair Game for Censorship While to convincingly prove this reality requires a deeper expos√©‚Äîcoming soon‚Äîon the Great Power Competition's connection to the government's focus on misinformation, disinformation, and mal-information, last week Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Arizona, showcased the current thinking inspiring our leaders. During a conference call with the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation about the Silicon Valley Bank bailout, Kelly asked whether there was ""a way to censor information on social media to prevent a run on the banks."" Kelly's question was ""couched"" ""in a concern that foreign actors would be doing this,"" Rep. Thomas Massie told Public, but, according to Massie, Kelly ""didn't suggest the censorship should be limited to foreigners or to things that were untrue."" The move from the censorship of terrorism to the silencing of supposed interference in elections to censoring posts about ""bank runs"" follows naturally from the shift in foreign relations paradigms from the War on Terror to the Great Powers Competition. The latter views anything affecting American power or influence as fair game. We also saw this shift with the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) proposal to consider ""financial misinformation"" within its purview. The government's censorship efforts won't stop at supposed ""financial misinformation,"" however, because anything and everything journalists report and citizens discuss affects America's ""power, influence, and interest."" So, the government's development of technology to monitor the entirety of the internet foretells a much more dangerous threat than apparent on the surface. 4. The Government Brands True Speech Misinformation The threat to free speech stemming from the government's monitoring of the internet is further increased by our overlords' willingness to brand true speech ""misinformation, disinformation, or mal-information"" and then seek to censor it. The ""Twitter Files"" also exposed this reality, with our government and its lackeys seeking the censorship of true facts that might lead to ""vaccine hesitancy"" or reveal runs on grocery stores. That our government would seek to silence true speech on such matters gives Americans reason to fear further censorship of true information. 5. Faulty Analysis and Biased Censors The ""Twitter Files"" also revealed that censorship demands by the government, think tanks, and academic institutions relied on faulty misinformation analyses, including ones that identified innocent Americans as foreign actors. Also, many of those involved in the disinformation industry maintain left-leaning bias and a penchant for targeting conservatives. In furthering its plans to monitor the internet for supposedly harmful narratives to silence, the government is continuing to work with biased groups, including ones that pushed faulty analyses, adding to the threat to free speech. 6. The Government's Partners Are Poised to Censor The government's push to develop AI and ML technology to mine the internet is even more terrifying knowing that a Censorship Complex has already been built. The ""Twitter Files"" revealed the breadth and depth of the complex, with every alphabet-soup federal agency working with the social media giants and an array of think tanks and academic institutions, and with the legacy media providing an assist when censorship requests went ignored. While Elon Musk may have exited Twitter from the group, the Censorship Complex still stands tall and ready to silence the speech of those who dare dissent. This public-private collaboration makes the government's move to monitor the internet even more threatening to free speech. 7. Those Who Could Warn the Public or Stop the Plot Are All-In The threat is further heightened because those with the power to warn the public and demand the government stop silencing Americans' speech are complicit. The corrupt media's coverage, or lack thereof, of Matt Taibbi and Michael Shellenberger's congressional testimony on the Censorship Complex proves this point. So too does the Democrats' pathetic performance during the hearings, when they exposed themselves as enemies of free speech. With Democrats, the legacy media, and many Republicans all in on the government's efforts to censor misinformation and disinformation, it will be extremely difficult for the public to recognize the risks free speech faces‚Äîespecially since those trying to sound the alarm have already been falsely branded purveyors of disinformation. A chance remains, though, that enough ordinary Americans will hear the message before it is too late and demand Congress close the Censorship-Industrial Complex.

A year later, Newsguard was given 750,000 to develop an AI-powered database of ""misinformation networks"" alongside the Department of Defense. NewsGuard is one of several such businesses funded by the Pentagon. PeakMetrics was another winner of the Covid-19 challenge, earning a 25,000 grant to develop ""social listening"" technology for the military. It received a further 1.5 million from the federal government in 2021, but even before that the company had been singled out as potentially useful to the Pentagon. In early 2020, PeakMetrics took part in the 'Air Force Accelerator' program, under which it developed ""measuring tools to detect misinformation campaigns."" According to The Federalist, it put these tools to use during the 2020 and 2022 elections in the US. At that point, PeakMetrics solely worked for the US State Department and Pentagon, before later offering its services to the private sector. It is unclear what the Pentagon aimed to achieve during these election monitoring campaigns. PeakMetrics did not respond to a request for comment by The Federalist.

'Cold-Calling' Big Tech The Stewart emails establish that in 2020, federal government actors contacted social media giants to promote GEC's Disinfo Cloud. GEC represented that this government platform provided ""companies, technology, and tools"" to ""assist with identifying, understanding, and addressing disinformation."" Then it gave private tech companies access to Disinfo Cloud. Almost identical to how GEC described Disinfo Cloud in congressional testimony, the State Department's webpage marketed it as a ""one-stop shop"" to ""identify and then test tools that counter propaganda and disinformation."" ""Fact checking"" and ""media authentication"" are just a couple of the types of technologies available through the dashboard. GEC didn't just promote Disinfo Cloud or give Big Tech access to what GEC called ""the U.S. government's online repository."" Government employees at GEC also offered to help private companies identify tools to suit their specific needs. Just ""write"" to the GEC's Technology Engagement Division about ""what your office needs to counter propaganda and disinformation,"" the State Department instructed on its webpage, and the government will ""assist"" in finding ""a technological solution."" 'Testbed' Access to Disinfo Cloud, according to the State Department's webpage, also provides ""a gateway"" to the GEC's Technology Engagement Division's ""Testbed,"" allowing users to review and test the technology against their unique needs. While Stewart's emails don't expressly mention the ""Testbed"" feature, the State Department boasts that the ""private sector"" uses both Disinfo Cloud and Testbed. The GEC's webpage also invites Disinfo Cloud users to ask ""for assistance in identifying a technological solution or draft a test proposal for a tool."" If Disinfo Cloud users can't find a tool that works for them, the GEC Technology Engagement team stresses it ""is open to insights and is here to help implement ideas to move the counter propaganda and disinformation mission forward."" Infomercials Deposition testimony by FBI Agent Elvis Chan suggests GEC's marketing of the censorship tools went beyond making cold calls (or emails) to LinkedIn and other Big Tech companies. It also seemingly went further than providing product advice and samples on Disinfo Cloud The GEC's Technology Engagement Division apparently hosted infomercials to help the private vendors market their censorship software. Chan, the assistant special agent in charge of the cyber branch at the FBI's San Francisco field office, was ""one of the primary people"" communicating with social media companies about supposed ""disinformation,"" and thus is one of the named defendants in Missouri v. Biden. As part of that litigation, the plaintiffs deposed Chan. During questioning, Chan testified that ahead of the 2020 election, he periodically spoke with Stewart, who would meet with the social media companies separately from Chan. According to Chan, Stewart met with policy individuals with the various social media companies about ""different initiatives."" Those initiatives included various kinds of vendor-made software ""that they would pilot to see if they could detect malign foreign influence on social media platforms."" Chan further testified that Stewart and GEC ""would provide webinars"" from these vendors. As Chan explained, "" T he State Department was just providing a venue where different vendors could show off their products."" The presentations were open to the general public, said Chan, but the GEC ""would invite all sorts of audiences, to include researchers, employees from State Department counterparts, so typically Ministry of Foreign Affairs."" The intended audience, according to Chan, was ""State Department-equivalent personnel, social media companies, and researchers."" Chan said he attended only a couple of the webinars because the companies took only a ""surface-level"" look at the content, and thus he didn't consider the technology useful to the FBI. But apparently, it was fine for the State Department to market the same tools to social media companies. From Chan's deposition testimony, it appears Stewart, the GEC's then-senior adviser, made the equivalent of sales calls and hosted infomercials, all for the purpose of pushing various censorship services to social media companies. It is unclear whether these webinars were in addition to the GEC's ""Tech Demo Series"" ‚Äî at which private vendors showcased their knack for fighting so-called disinformation for ""U.S. government counterparts and foreign partners"" ‚Äî or whether, after the GEC sent a full-time representative to Silicon Valley in December of 2019 (presumably Stewart), the Tech Demo Series was opened to the public. However, given that the official Disinfo Cloud Twitter account promoted the Tech Demo Series, it seems likely that GEC expanded its target audience for the series to include the private sector and other Disinfo Cloud users. Either way, Chan's deposition testimony reveals our government marketed censorship technology to social media companies through ""webinars."" And while Chan claimed he didn't think GEC endorsed the products, the government expressly represented the Disinfo Cloud technology as tools to ""assist"" with attacking so-called disinformation. The Tools So what exactly were those tools? From open-source material, it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify the entire dataset of tech companies featured on Disinfo Cloud or participating in the Tech Demo Series. That's because Disinfo Cloud has ""been retired as a GEC-sponsored effort,"" according to the State Department. The DisinfoCloud.com webpage has also been shuttered. But because GEC ran various ""tech challenges,"" giving winners State Department ""sponsorship"" on the government's Disinfo Cloud Testbed ‚Äî advertised as worth 25,000 ‚Äî among other things, several censorship companies involved can be identified, including NewsGuard, PeakMetrics, and Omelas. NewsGuard's censorship technology includes ""its unreliable reliability ratings database of thousands of news and information websites and a second database of purported hoaxes,"" as I detailed in March. NewsGuard's winning tech-challenge entry built upon those databases and used ""AI and social listening tools to identify the initial source of the hoax,"" and to find instances of the hoax being ""repeated or amplified"" online. The second winner, PeakMetrics, offered a dashboard for tracking mentions of a topic across multiple media channels with social listening technology. The third winner, Omelas, developed tools to visually map online information. The government gave these winners the ability to pilot their technology on Disinfo Cloud's Testbed. Then it promoted Disinfo Cloud to social media giants as offering ""access to companies, technology, and tools that can assist with identifying, understanding, and addressing disinformation."" So were NewsGuard, PeakMetrics, and Omelas among the companies GEC marketed to Big Tech? Did they participate in the government-run Tech Demos and present infomercials to the private sector? Did GEC help these vendors test their products for private companies on the Testbed? In Practice Consider the implications, using NewsGuard to illustrate. NewsGuard rates various media outlets on a 100-point scale and provides a red ""unreliable"" rating if its ""experts"" score the news source below 60. The company rates The Federalist ""red"" and claims it is one of the top-10 ""most influential misinformers."" Conversely, some of the outlets that botched the biggest political stories of the century maintain a 100 percent reliability score. The government awarded NewsGuard a 25,000 prize to develop new technology on Disinfo Cloud, using, in part, that ratings system as a backbone. NewsGuard would later receive an additional 750,000 from the government to advance the development of its censorship technology. PeakMetrics and Omelas also both scored additional government funding of 1.5 and 1 million respectively. But think about the government's other behind-the-scenes censorship entanglements. The government, via your tax dollars, funded both Disinfo Cloud, which provided the technology necessary to pilot the program, and the outside contractor, Park Advisors, that managed it. The State Department's GEC promoted the companies and technology featured on Disinfo Cloud, and a government liaison working for GEC personally contacted social media companies to encourage them to use the platform. The government also hosted Tech Demo Series for the vendors to market their products to the private sector. Disinfo Cloud regularly promoted private censorship technology on its official Twitter account and retweeted NewsGuard's announcement of its partnership with Mediabrands to ""bring NewsGaurd's rating work to TV news programming. Then beyond promoting the censorship tools, government employees working with GEC helped social media and private-sector businesses identify, test, and tweak the most ""appropriate"" technology for their ""needs."" And what are those ""needs?"" Censoring the speech of you and your fellow Americans. A Scandal Like No Other",0.5,0.5051392,0.40810424
